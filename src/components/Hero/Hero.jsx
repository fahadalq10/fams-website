            Soft and bio-inspired mechatronic systems could effectively deal with uncertain or constrained environments while maximizing the usersâ€™ safety. For example, the development of soft robotic structures faces a number of scientific challenges, including material selection, fabrication techniques, and kinematic simulation. There are currently big knowledge gaps in the fabrication, control, and application of versatile soft robotic platforms.
